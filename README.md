## **Purpose**

The purpose of this website is to both demonstrate the skills I possess in building websites that are simple, effective and engaging as well as highlighting my background and soft skills that will compliment the technical foundations that I am building upon.

## **Functionality / features**

This website is designed to be responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop devices. I have created 4 main pages that all follow a similar theme with their banner pictures of nature and the elements. I have used a minimalist design with muted colors and only one highlighting color that is used for links and hover pseudo-classes. This is the same color I have used for the brackets in my logo.

I have adapted [JavaScript](./README.md#useful-resources) that I found on W3Shcools to build a lightbox for the Blog photos. I also adapted some [JavaScript](./README.md#useful-resources) for a scroll to top button. The four main pages on the website are:

- Landing Page / Home: This is the landing page and has a brief description about myself and a call to action to sign up to my blog.
- About: This page has some information about my previous work history and a section on why I have chosen to transition into tech. I've also included a section with my interests. Lastly, there is a section where visitors can find more information via phone and email links and a link to my resume.
- Projects: This page has 4 preview cards that link to projects I have recently completed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Blog: This is the blog homepage. It has its own nav bar for navigating to any of the 5 current blog posts as well as preview cards for each blog post. Each Blog post has a title, sub title and 6 thumbnail images at the bottom. The thumbnails can be clicked to open a lightbox showing the full image. The lightbox also has thumbnails and previous/next buttons on the side of the full image.
