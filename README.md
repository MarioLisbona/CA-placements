## **Current Studies**

Prior to full time study I had been teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and git methodologies though a few different free sites like <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/' target='_blank'>The Odin Project</a>, <a href='https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/' target='_blank'>Web Dev Simplified</a> and <a href='https://javascriptsimplified.com/' target='_blank'>JavaScript Simplified</a>. I completed a few projects through another site called <a href='https://www.frontendmentor.io/' target='_blank'>Frontend Mentor</a> as well.

During term 1 of the <a href='https://www.coderacademy.edu.au/web-development-bootcamp' target='_blank'>Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp</a> at <a href='https://www.coderacademy.edu.au/' target='_blank'>Coder Academy</a> we studied HTML and CSS and used that knowledge to build static websites. The final term 1 assignment brief was to build a <a href='https://mariolisbona.github.io/CA-T1A2-portfolio/index.html' target='_blank'>profile website</a> that is fully responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop. We also studied Python and used that language to build a <a href='https://github.com/MarioLisbona/CA-T1A3-terminal-app' target='_blank'>terminal application</a>. I chose to build a contacts database using the Rich and TinyDB third party modules. I also had wrote bash scripts to install all the correct dependencies for the application to work on other systems.

In term 2 we continued our study of Python with the addition of the Flask framework and PostgreSQL database and used those technologies to build an <a href='https://github.com/MarioLisbona/CA-T2A2-API-Webserver' target='_blank'>API Webserver</a>. I chose to build a forum that is a RESTful API with full CRUD operations that returns JSON at numerous endpoints. Users can register and use the forum with JWT authentication implemented. Authenticated users can read, post, reply and delete their owns posts to the forum. The forum has a variety of channels that users can post to. Users with administration privileges can moderate the forum by being able to delete users, posts and replies as well as issuing warnings to users for conduct that goes against the forum community guidelines.

We are currently in the process of learning to develop a full stack MERN application and will have to complete a Full Stack App as our final project. Im really enjoying learning React at the moment and seeing how powerful and expressive the framework is.
