## **Study**

Prior to full time study I had been self teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and git methodologies though a few different free sites like [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and [Web Dev Simplified](https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/). I completed a few projects through another site called [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) as well.

During the course so far weâ€™ve studied, HTML, CSS to build static websites and a [profile website](https://mariolisbona.github.io/CA-T1A2-portfolio/index.html) thats fully responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop for the final term 1 assignment. We also studied python and build a [terminal application](https://github.com/MarioLisbona/CA-T1A3-terminal-app). I chose to build a contacts database using the Rich and TinyDB third party modules. I also had wrote a bash script to install all the correct dependencies for the application to work.

In term 2 we studied Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL and used those technologies to build an [API Webserver](https://github.com/MarioLisbona/CA-T2A2-API-Webserver). I chose to build a forum API with full CRUD operations. Users can register and use the forum with JWT authentication. Authenticated users can read, post, reply and delete their owns posts to the forum. Users with administration privileges can moderate the forum by being able to delete users, posts and replies as well as issuing warnings to users for conduct that goes against the forum community guidelines.

We are currently in the process of learning to develop a full stack MERN application and will have to complete a Full Stack App as our final project. Im really enjoying learning React at the moment and seeing how powerful and expressive the framework is.
